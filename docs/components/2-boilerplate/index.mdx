Get started with my tailor-fit no dependencies components for building responsive, mobile-first sites,
with a template starter page.

## Starter Template {class="text-xl font-semibold !mb-4"}

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype
and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look
like this:

<BoilerplateTemplate />
